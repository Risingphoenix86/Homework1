# Homework1

This project was to refactor provided code and style sheet for a webpage to meet the customer's needs. The index.html file had the various <div> sections renamed
to the appropriate standardized names, and missing tags or cade was implemented to allow the page to function as required.

The Style.css file had many of the code segments combined into standardized classes and those classes implemented to the correct sections of the .html file.

The webpage maintained its original look, and the broken lnk of Search engine optimization from the header section has been repaired
The webpage can be viewed at: https://risingphoenix86.github.io/Homework1/
